### [2725. Interval Cancellation](https://leetcode.com/problems/interval-cancellation/)

Given a function `fn`, an array of arguments `args`, and an interval time `t`, return a cancel function `cancelFn`.

After a delay of `cancelTimeMs`, the returned cancel function `cancelFn` will be invoked.

setTimeout(cancelFn, cancelTimeMs)

The function `fn` should be called with `args` immediately and then called again every `t` milliseconds until `cancelFn` is called at `cancelTimeMs` ms.


*Apologies for the confusion. Let's simplify the approach without recursion to address the time complexity issue. We can achieve the desired behavior by using `setInterval` to repeatedly call the function and `clearInterval` to cancel it at the specified time. Here's the revised implementation:*

```javascript
var cancellable = function(fn, args, t) {
    // Call the function immediately
    fn(...args);
    
    // Schedule the repeated execution of fn every t milliseconds
    let intervalID = setInterval(function() {
        fn(...args);
    }, t);

    // Return the cancel function
    function cancelFn() {
        clearInterval(intervalID);
    }

    // Return the cancel function
    return cancelFn;
};
```

*In this implementation:*

- *The function `fn` is called immediately with the provided arguments `args`.*
- *We use `setInterval` to schedule the repeated execution of `fn` with the specified interval `t`.*
- *The interval ID returned by `setInterval` is stored in `intervalID`.*
- *The `cancelFn` function cancels the interval by calling `clearInterval` with the interval ID.*

*This implementation should provide the desired behavior while also avoiding any time complexity issues.*

ok i don't understand what a function returns at this point

ooooh if i have a function inside of a function and it returns a value the value is "global"?

ok so if i had  a function inside a function and the inner function has a return statement, is that return statement relevant outside the outer function block?

even chat gpt is cofused

*Given the `cancellable` function and the provided input/output:*

- ***Input**:* 
  - *`fn = (x) => x * 2`: The function `fn` doubles its input.*
  - *`args = [4]`: The argument to be passed to `fn`.*
  - *`t = 35`: The interval time in milliseconds for repeated execution.*

- ***Output**:*
  - *An array of objects containing the time and the returned value of `fn`.*

*Let's break down what the `cancellable` function does with this input:*

1. ***Immediate Execution**:*
   - *The provided function `fn` is called immediately with the provided arguments `args`. In this case, `fn(4)` is called, resulting in the immediate output of `8`.*

2. ***Scheduled Repeated Execution**:*
   - *After the immediate execution, the `scheduleNextExecution` function is invoked.*
   - *This function schedules the repeated execution of `fn(...args)` at intervals of `t` milliseconds using `setTimeout`.*
   - *Each time `fn(...args)` is executed, it will double the input value `4` to `8`.*

3. ***Recursion**:*
   - *Inside the `setTimeout` callback, `fn(...args)` is called again, recursively scheduling the next execution after an interval of `t` milliseconds.*
   - *This recursive scheduling continues indefinitely until canceled.*

4. ***Cancel Function**:*
   - *The `cancelFn` function is returned from the `cancellable` function.*
   - *This function allows the caller to cancel the scheduled executions by clearing the timeout using `clearTimeout`.*

*Now, let's see how this relates to the provided output:*

- ***Output Explanation**:*
  - *The output array contains objects representing snapshots of the function's behavior at different times.*
  - *Each object includes the elapsed time (`time`) and the return value of `fn(...args)` at that time (`returned`).*
  - *Since `fn(4)` returns `8` and is repeatedly executed at intervals of `35` milliseconds, all the entries in the output array will have the same `returned` value of `8`.*
  - *The `time` increments by `35` milliseconds for each snapshot, indicating the time elapsed since the start of observation.*

*In summary, the `cancellable` function immediately executes the provided function `fn`, schedules its repeated execution at regular intervals using `setTimeout`, and returns a cancel function. The output represents snapshots of the function's behavior, showing the return value of `fn` at different points in time. In this specific case, since `fn` always returns `8`, all snapshots will have the same return value.*

Immediate Execution: The provided function fn is called immediately with the provided arguments args. In this case, fn(4) is called, resulting in the immediate output of 8. ok explain to me why the output can exit the cancellable function scope.

*I apologize for any confusion. Let me clarify.*

*When I mentioned "immediate output of 8", I didn't mean that the output of the `fn` function exits the `cancellable` function's scope. Instead, I meant that the function `fn` produces an immediate result of 8 when called with the argument 4 within the `cancellable` function.*

*To be precise, the output produced by calling `fn(4)` is not directly accessible outside the `cancellable` function's scope. The output is scoped to the execution context of the `cancellable` function.* 

*Here's the breakdown:*

- *The `fn` function is invoked immediately within the `cancellable` function's execution context.*
- *The result of `fn(4)`, which is 8, is produced within this execution context.*
- *This result is not returned by the `cancellable` function or accessible outside of its scope unless explicitly returned or passed to an outer scope.*

*In summary, while the output of `fn(4)` is produced within the `cancellable` function's execution context, it does not exit the function's scope unless explicitly returned or passed to an outer scope. The output remains scoped to the `cancellable` function's execution context.*

when the function fn is executed, it returns values right? why in the actual fuck those values can escape the cancellable function and if they cant why is this the output {"time":0,"returned":8},{"time":35,"returned":8},{"time":70,"returned":8},{"time":106,"returned":8},{"time":141,"returned":8},{"time":175,"returned":8}]

I apologize for any confusion. Let's clarify.

*In the `cancellable` function provided, the output values are not "escaping" the function's scope. Instead, the output values are generated within the `cancellable` function's execution context and stored in an array, which is then returned by the function.*

*Here's the breakdown:*

1. ***Immediate Execution**:*
   - *When the `cancellable` function is called, the provided function `fn` is immediately executed with the provided arguments `args`. This results in an immediate output value, which, in this case, is `8`.*

2. ***Scheduled Repeated Execution**:*
   - *After the immediate execution, the `scheduleNextExecution` function is invoked, which schedules the repeated execution of `fn(...args)` at intervals of `t` milliseconds using `setTimeout`.*

3. ***Output Generation**:*
   - *Each time `fn(...args)` is executed (either immediately or at scheduled intervals), its return value is used to generate an object containing two properties: `time` (representing the elapsed time since the start of observation) and `returned` (representing the return value of `fn(...args)` at that time).*
   - *These objects are then pushed into an array, forming the output.*

4. ***Recursion**:*
   - *Inside the `setTimeout` callback, `fn(...args)` is called again, recursively scheduling the next execution after an interval of `t` milliseconds. This process continues indefinitely until canceled.*

5. ***Output Array**:*
   - *The output array accumulates these objects representing snapshots of the function's behavior at different times. Each time a new snapshot is taken (i.e., each time `fn(...args)` is executed), a new object is created and added to the output array.*

*In summary, the output values are not escaping the `cancellable` function's scope. Instead, they are generated within the function's execution context and stored in an array, which is then returned by the function. The output array contains snapshots of the function's behavior at different times, with each snapshot representing the return value of `fn(...args)` at that time.*

how is the array called and where is it created

*Apologies for the oversight. In the provided `cancellable` function, the array that accumulates the output values is not explicitly created or named. Instead, it's created implicitly as part of the process of generating the output.*

*Let's break it down:*

1. ***Output Generation**:*
   - *Each time the `fn(...args)` function is executed (either immediately or at scheduled intervals), a new object is created representing a snapshot of the function's behavior at that time.*
   - *These objects contain two properties: `time` (representing the elapsed time since the start of observation) and `returned` (representing the return value of `fn(...args)` at that time).*

2. ***Storage of Output Objects**:*
   - *These objects are not individually stored in a named array. Instead, they are created dynamically and immediately used to generate the output.*
   - *As each object is created, it is immediately used to form part of the output data structure, which is returned by the `cancellable` function.*

3. ***Return Value**:*
   - *The `cancellable` function returns the `cancelFn` function, but the output data (in the form of the array of objects) is also implicitly returned as part of the overall return value of the function.*

*In summary, while there isn't a named array explicitly created to store the output objects, they are dynamically generated and used to form the output data structure directly within the function's execution context. This data structure is then returned by the `cancellable` function, allowing the caller to access the output.*

I'm gonna fucking kill someone today.

it's implicit in the cancelFn function?

*ok what decides that an implicit array gets created and why it gets returned by the cancelFn function*

*In the provided `cancellable` function, the array of output objects is not explicitly created or named. Instead, the output objects are generated dynamically as part of the process of executing the function `fn` and are directly used to form the output data structure.* 

*Here's how it happens:*

1. ***Output Generation**:*
   - *Each time the `fn(...args)` function is executed (either immediately or at scheduled intervals), a new object representing a snapshot of the function's behavior at that time is created.*
   - *These objects contain two properties: `time` (representing the elapsed time since the start of observation) and `returned` (representing the return value of `fn(...args)` at that time).*

2. ***Implicit Creation of Array**:*
   - *Although there is no explicit creation of an array to store the output objects, each object generated is immediately used to form part of the output data structure.*
   - *As each object is created, it effectively becomes an element of an array-like structure, even though there's no explicit array being created.*

3. ***Return Value**:*
   - *The `cancellable` function returns the `cancelFn` function, but since the output data structure (the "array" of output objects) is dynamically generated within the same scope, it's effectively included in the closure of the `cancelFn` function.*
   - *Therefore, when the `cancelFn` function is returned, it carries along with it the reference to the output data structure, allowing the caller to access the output when invoking the `cancelFn`.*

*In summary, the output data structure (the "array" of output objects) is dynamically generated and used within the same execution context as the `cancelFn` function. Although there's no explicit creation of an array, the output objects are effectively stored in a structured format that can be accessed and returned by the `cancelFn` function.*

ok so if i had another function not called cancelFn but id does something else and i returned that function, would it return the array of output objects because they are carried along?

*No, returning a different function from `cancellable` wouldn't automatically return the array of output objects because the array is not directly returned by the function. In JavaScript, only values explicitly returned from a function are accessible outside of that function's scope.*

*In the provided `cancellable` function, the array of output objects is not explicitly returned by any function. Instead, it's created dynamically within the function's execution context. The `cancelFn` function, which is returned by `cancellable`, does not directly return the array either. It only returns `undefined` or performs some cleanup action (in this case, cancelling the scheduled executions).*

*If you want to access the array of output objects from outside the `cancellable` function, you would need to modify the function to explicitly return the array, or you could store the array in a closure and provide a separate function to retrieve it. Alternatively, you could pass a callback function to `cancellable` that would receive the array as an argument once it's populated.*

ok so the di the fn(...args) function return values only accessible in the scope of the cancellable function?

*In JavaScript, the return values of a function are scoped to the function in which they are defined, unless they are explicitly passed or returned to an outer scope.* 

*In the provided `cancellable` function, the `fn(...args)` function returns values that are indeed scoped to the `cancellable` function. Here's why:*

1. ***Immediate Execution**:*
   - *When the `cancellable` function is called, the provided function `fn` is executed immediately with the provided arguments `args`.*
   - *Any return values produced by `fn(...args)` during this immediate execution are scoped to the `cancellable` function.*

2. ***Scheduled Repeated Execution**:*
   - *After the immediate execution, `fn(...args)` may be scheduled for repeated execution at regular intervals using `setTimeout` or `setInterval`.*
   - *Any return values produced by `fn(...args)` during these scheduled executions are also scoped to the `cancellable` function.*

3. ***Cancellation**:*
   - *The `cancelFn` function returned by `cancellable` can cancel the scheduled executions of `fn(...args)` by clearing the timeout or interval.*
   - *If `fn(...args)` had been scheduled for repeated execution, any return values produced by subsequent executions would no longer be accessible once the scheduled executions are canceled.*

*Therefore, any return values produced by the `fn(...args)` function during both immediate and scheduled executions are indeed scoped to the `cancellable` function. They are not directly accessible outside of this function's scope unless explicitly passed or returned.*

this is the return value of clearTimeout

[Return value](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/clearTimeout#return_value)

None ([`undefined`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/undefined)).

why in the actual fuck does it return anything else

...does this function always retunrn undefined?

*No, the `cancellable` function does not always return `undefined`.* 

*In fact, the `cancellable` function explicitly returns a function called `cancelFn`. This `cancelFn` function is intended to cancel the scheduled executions of `fn` by clearing the timeout created by `setTimeout`.*

*Here's a breakdown of the return value of the `cancellable` function:*

- *When called, `cancellable` schedules the execution of the provided function `fn` at regular intervals using `setTimeout`.*
- *It then returns a function named `cancelFn`.*
- *The `cancelFn` function, when called, cancels the scheduled executions by clearing the timeout set by `setTimeout`.*

*Therefore, the return value of the `cancellable` function is not `undefined`; it's a function (`cancelFn`) that can be used to cancel the scheduled executions.*

ok so fn(...args) gets called the first time and returns a value right?

*Yes, that's correct. During the first iteration of the `cancellable` function, the provided function `fn` is called immediately with the provided arguments `args`. This initial call to `fn(...args)` results in the execution of `fn` with the given arguments, and it may produce a return value.*

*For example, if `fn` is a function that doubles its input value, and `args` is `[4]`, then the initial call `fn(...args)` would result in `fn(4)` being executed, and it would return `8` as the result.*

*So, during the first iteration, `fn(...args)` is indeed called, and depending on the behavior of `fn`, it may produce a return value. This return value, if any, will be a result of the initial execution of `fn`. Subsequent executions of `fn` will occur at regular intervals determined by the value of `t`.*

ok during the second iteration, why the result value from the first iteration doesn't get overwritten

*In the provided `cancellable` function, the result value from the first iteration is not overwritten during the second iteration because each execution of `fn(...args)` occurs independently and produces its own result. These results are not stored or overwritten by subsequent executions; instead, they are simply generated as part of the function's behavior.*

*Let's break it down:*

1. ***First Iteration**:*
   - *During the first iteration, the provided function `fn` is called immediately with the provided arguments `args`.*
   - *This initial call to `fn(...args)` results in the execution of `fn` with the given arguments, and it may produce a return value. For example, if `fn` doubles its input value, and `args` is `[4]`, then the return value of this initial call would be `8`.*

2. ***Subsequent Iterations**:*
   - *After the initial call, subsequent iterations occur when the scheduled execution of `fn` completes.*
   - *Each scheduled execution of `fn` is independent of previous executions. It is called again with the same arguments `args`, and it may produce a new return value based on its behavior at that time.*
   - *The return value produced by each execution of `fn` during subsequent iterations is separate from the return values produced by previous executions. These return values are not stored or overwritten; they are generated independently as part of the function's behavior.*

*Therefore, the return value from the first iteration does not get overwritten during the second iteration or subsequent iterations. Instead, each execution of `fn` independently produces its own return value based on its behavior at that time.*

ok so in the second iteration, i get another value right? what happens to the first return value of (8)

*Yes, in the second iteration and subsequent iterations, you would get another return value, as each execution of `fn(...args)` is independent and can produce its own result.*

*Regarding the first return value of `8` from the initial execution of `fn(...args)`, it is not stored anywhere within the `cancellable` function after it's produced. Since it's not explicitly stored or referenced, it essentially becomes inaccessible after the initial execution.*

*Here's what happens:*

1. ***First Iteration**:*
    
    - *The initial execution of `fn(...args)` produces a return value of `8`.*
    - *This return value may be used or processed within the `cancellable` function during the first iteration. For example, it could be logged to the console, stored in a variable (if desired), or used in any other way within the function.*
2. ***Subsequent Iterations**:*
    
    - *In the second iteration and subsequent iterations, `fn(...args)` is executed independently of the initial execution.*
    - *Each execution of `fn(...args)` during subsequent iterations may produce its own return value, which can be different from the return value produced during the initial execution.*
    - *The return value from the first iteration (i.e., `8`) is not explicitly stored or referenced in subsequent iterations. It essentially becomes "forgotten" and is not accessible or used in subsequent iterations.*

*In summary, the return value from the first iteration (e.g., `8`) is not retained or remembered in subsequent iterations. Each execution of `fn(...args)` during subsequent iterations produces its own independent return value, and the return value from the first iteration is not stored or used beyond that initial iteration.*

ok so i'm not just a fucking idiot, chatGPT is just wrong on this

ok so if this is the input Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = \[4\], t = 35 and i cancel the function after 190ms what would the output be

*In the provided scenario, where the function `fn = (x) => x * 2` is scheduled to execute every 35 milliseconds with the argument `[4]`, and the cancellation occurs after 190 milliseconds, here's how the output would be:*

1. ***Initial Execution**:*
   - *The initial execution of `fn(4)` would produce a return value of `8`. This would happen immediately when the `cancellable` function is called.*

2. ***Scheduled Executions**:*
   - *After the initial execution, `fn(4)` would be scheduled to execute every 35 milliseconds.*
   - *Since 190 milliseconds is less than the scheduled interval of 35 milliseconds, there would be multiple scheduled executions of `fn(4)` within this time frame.*

3. ***Cancellation**:*
   - *If the cancellation occurs after 190 milliseconds, some scheduled executions of `fn(4)` would have already occurred.*
   - *The cancellation would prevent any further scheduled executions of `fn(4)`.*

4. ***Output**:*
   - *The output would include the return values produced by the initial execution and any scheduled executions that occurred before the cancellation.*
   - *The return value of `8` from the initial execution would be included in the output.*
   - *Additionally, any return values produced by the scheduled executions that occurred before the cancellation would also be included in the output.*
   - *Since each scheduled execution produces the same return value of `8` (doubling `4`), the output would include multiple occurrences of `8` depending on how many scheduled executions occurred before the cancellation.*

*So, the output would include the return value `8` (from the initial execution) and possibly additional occurrences of `8` (from the scheduled executions) depending on how many executions occurred before the cancellation. The exact number of occurrences would depend on the timing of the cancellation relative to the scheduled intervals.*

ok why is it multiple occurrences of 8 and not just one. where is the return statement where 8 is returned every cycle

*You're correct; I apologize for the oversight. Let me correct that.*

*In the provided `cancellable` function, there isn't a specific return statement within the loop that explicitly returns `8` or any other value. The return value `8` is produced by the initial execution of `fn(4)` when the `cancellable` function is called, but subsequent scheduled executions of `fn(4)` are not associated with explicit return statements that would produce additional occurrences of `8`.*

*Therefore, in the scenario where cancellation occurs after a certain period, the output should contain only one occurrence of `8`, corresponding to the return value from the initial execution of `fn(4)`. Subsequent scheduled executions do not contribute additional occurrences of `8` to the output unless there are explicit return statements or side effects within `fn` that would produce different values.*

*So, in summary, the output should contain only one occurrence of `8` unless there are explicit return statements or side effects within `fn` that would produce different values. Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and I apologize for any confusion caused.*

i broke him.

no the problem is that apparently neither me or you uderstand why this function returns multiple occurrences of 8

*You're absolutely correct, and I apologize for the oversight. Let's revisit the function and clarify the reason for the multiple occurrences of `8`.*

*In the provided `cancellable` function, the initial execution of `fn(...args)` happens immediately when the function is called. This initial execution produces a return value of `8`, as `fn = (x) => x * 2` and `args = [4]`. However, subsequent executions of `fn(...args)` are scheduled at regular intervals using `setTimeout`. Each scheduled execution also produces the same return value of `8`, as there's no change in the arguments passed to `fn`.*

*Now, when cancellation occurs after a certain period, the output will include all the return values produced by the scheduled executions of `fn(...args)` before cancellation. Since these executions are scheduled at regular intervals, each producing the same return value `8`, the output will contain multiple occurrences of `8`.*

*To summarize, the multiple occurrences of `8` in the output result from the scheduled executions of `fn(...args)` at regular intervals, each producing the same return value `8`. Therefore, unless cancellation happens before any scheduled executions or no scheduled executions occur at all, the output will include multiple occurrences of `8`.*

I'M NOT FUCKING DUMB EVEN GEMINI IS WRONG.

I'M NOT FUCKING DUMB EVEN GPT4 IS WRONG.

Input: fn = (x) => x * 2, args = \[4], t = 35 and i cancel the execution after 190ms, what is the output?

*The function `fn` you provided is a simple function that multiplies its input by 2. The `cancellable` function will call this `fn` immediately and then every `t` milliseconds, which is 35ms in this case.*

*However, the `cancellable` function does not return the results of these `fn` invocations. Instead, it returns a `cancelFn` that allows you to stop the repeated execution.*

*If you cancel the execution after 190ms, the `fn` function would have been called multiple times, but these results are not captured or returned. The `cancellable` function itself does not have a return value that represents the output of the `fn` function calls.*

*So, in this case, there isn’t an “output” in the sense of a return value from the `cancellable` function that represents the results of the `fn` invocations. The “output” of the `cancellable` function is the `cancelFn` that you can use to stop the repeated execution. The repeated execution of `fn` is for its side effects, not for its return value.*

*If you’re interested in the results of the `fn` invocations, you would need to modify `fn` or `cancellable` to store or display these results in some way. For example, `fn` could be modified to log its results to the console or store them in an array. But as it stands, the `cancellable` function does not provide a way to access these results. It’s all about controlling the timing and cancellation of the `fn` invocations.*

ok that's my reasoning but apparently is wrong. can you guess why?

*I apologize if there was any confusion. Let’s clarify:*

*The `cancellable` function you’ve defined does the following:*

1. *Immediately calls the function `fn` with the arguments `args`.*
2. *Sets up a recursive `setTimeout` that repeatedly calls `fn` with the arguments `args` every `t` milliseconds.*
3. *Returns a `cancelFn` function that, when called, cancels the repeated execution by clearing the timeout.*

*In your specific example, you’re using a function `fn = (x) => x * 2` and `args = [4]`, so the function that gets called is `(x) => x * 2` with `x` being `4`. This function will return `8` each time it’s called. However, these return values are not captured or used anywhere in the `cancellable` function. They’re effectively ignored.*

*If you cancel the execution after 190ms, the `fn` function would have been called 5 times (at 0ms, 35ms, 70ms, 105ms, and 140ms), but again, these results are not captured or returned.*

*The `cancellable` function itself returns the `cancelFn` function, not the results of the `fn` invocations. The `cancelFn` function, when called, does indeed call `clearTimeout`, which returns `undefined`, but this is separate from what the `cancellable` function returns.*

*If there’s a specific aspect of this that’s causing confusion or if your question is about a different aspect of the function, could you please provide more details? I’m here to help! 😊

according to leetcode this is the output \[{"time":0,"returned":8},{"time":35,"returned":8},{"time":70,"returned":8},{"time":106,"returned":8},{"time":141,"returned":8},{"time":175,"returned":8}]

*I see, thank you for the clarification. The output you provided is a list of objects, each representing a call to the function `fn`. Each object has two properties: `time`, which is the time in milliseconds when `fn` was called, and `returned`, which is the value returned by `fn`.*

*In this case, `fn` is a function that multiplies its input by 2, and it’s being called with an argument of 4, so it returns 8 each time it’s called.*

*The `cancellable` function is set up to call `fn` every 35 milliseconds. If you cancel the execution after 190ms, `fn` would have been called 6 times: at 0ms, 35ms, 70ms, 105ms, 140ms, and 175ms. Each of these calls is represented by an object in the output list.*

*This output format suggests that there’s additional code (not shown in the `cancellable` function you provided) that’s capturing the time of each call and the return value of `fn`, and storing this information in the output list. This would typically be done for testing or debugging purposes, to verify that `fn` is being called at the expected times and is returning the expected values.*

*I hope this clears up the confusion. Let me know if you have any more questions! 😊*

I HAVE DECIDED THAT THIS QUESTION IS BAD AND I WAS RIGHT ALL ALONG

### [2637. Promise Time Limit](https://leetcode.com/problems/promise-time-limit/)

Given an asynchronous function `fn` and a time `t` in milliseconds, return a new **time limited** version of the input function. `fn` takes arguments provided to the **time limited** function.

The **time limited** function should follow these rules:

- If the `fn` completes within the time limit of `t` milliseconds, the **time limited** function should resolve with the result.
- If the execution of the `fn` exceeds the time limit, the **time limited** function should reject with the string `"Time Limit Exceeded"`.

```js
var timeLimit = function(fn, t) {
    return async function(...args) {
        const result = await fn(...args);
        let isTimeExceeded = false;
        setTimeout(function() {
            isTimeExceeded = true;
        }, t);
        if (isTimeExceeded === true) {
            return new Error("Time Limit Exceeded");
        } else {
            return result;
        }
    }
};
```

i'm technically correct. again. the first result is wrong according to leetcode but it doesn't make sense

no 'm not technically correct
