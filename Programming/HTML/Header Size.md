https://ux.stackexchange.com/questions/75242/what-is-an-average-header-height-for-mobile-websites

The correct answer is: **it depends on your app**.

But here are some important considerations for mobile websites to help you make the decision:

- **OS guidelines**. Mobile OS's publish guidelines around header heights. IOS has guidelines for menu and nav bar layouts (for example, see [this](http://iosdesign.ivomynttinen.com/)). Google also publishes guidelines for Material Design sites ([here](http://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/metrics-keylines.html#metrics-keylines-keylines-spacing)).
    
- **Ergonomics**. Whether or not you decide to follow guidelines, minimum bar height should be design so that it's touch friendly. [This article](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2012/02/21/finger-friendly-design-ideal-mobile-touchscreen-target-sizes/) has some excellent guidelines on touch-friendly heights based on specifications from Apple, Microsoft, Nokia and others. Although it's a bit dated, it notes:
    
    - Apple's iPhone Human Interface Guidelines recommend 44px minimum dimension. Microsoft recommends 34px, and Nokia has a minimum of 28px.

Hope that helps.
