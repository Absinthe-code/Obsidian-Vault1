Promises in JavaScript are objects that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. They are a way to handle asynchronous operations without blocking the rest of your code.

Here’s a basic overview of how Promises work:

1. **Creation**: A Promise is created with the `new Promise()` constructor, which takes a single argument: a callback function (also known as the “executor function”) with two parameters, typically named `resolve` and `reject`.

```javascript
let promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // asynchronous operation goes here
});
```

2. **Execution**: The executor function starts executing immediately when the Promise is created. It contains the code of the asynchronous operation.
    
3. **Settling**: Once the asynchronous operation is complete, the Promise is “settled” by calling either the `resolve` or `reject` function:
    - `resolve(value)`: If the operation was successful, `resolve` is called with the resulting value.
    - `reject(error)`: If an error occurred, `reject` is called with an Error object.
4. **Consumption**: The result of the Promise (whether it was resolved or rejected) can be consumed using the `.then` method for resolution, and the `.catch` method for rejection.
    

```javascript
promise
    .then(result => {
        // handle successful result
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // handle error
    });
```

The `.then` method returns a Promise, allowing for method chaining. If a `.then` handler function returns a value, the Promise returned by `.then` gets resolved with the returned value as its value. If the handler throws an error, the Promise returned by `.then` gets rejected with the thrown error as its value.

5. **Finally**: The `.finally` method allows you to specify code that runs when the Promise settles, regardless of its outcome. This is useful for cleanup tasks, for example.

```javascript
promise
    .then(result => {
        // handle successful result
    })
    .catch(error => {
        // handle error
    })
    .finally(() => {
        // code to run on settlement
    });
```

Remember, Promises are a way to manage asynchronous operations, allowing you to have a non-blocking, asynchronous flow in your JavaScript code. They can be a bit tricky to understand at first, but with practice, they become a powerful tool in your JavaScript toolkit.
